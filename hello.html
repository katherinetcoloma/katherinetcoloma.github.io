    <p Theirs was a true love, thought <span id="name-1">(name)</span>, one to stand the test of time. <span id="name-2">(number)</span>, his soul-mate, was somehow even more <span id="adjective-1">(number)</span> than the day they first met, he realized. And even though <span id="pronoun">(number)</span> always seemed to say something interesting, it ultimately didn't matter, as he was <span id="adjective-2">(number)</span> just to hear her soft, melodic voice.

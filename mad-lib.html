    <p> Theirs was a true love, thought <span id="name-1">(name)</span>, 
    one to stand the test of time. <span id="name-2">(name)</span>,
    his soul-mate, was somehow even more <span id="adjective-1">(adjective)</span> 
    than the day they first met, he realized. And even though <span id="pronoun">(pronoun)</span> 
    always seemed to say something interesting, it ultimately didn't matter, as he 
    was <span id="adjective-2">(ajective)</span> just to hear her soft, melodic voice. 
    Someday soon, he imagined, they would have children together, and 
    their <span id="noun">(noun)</span> would blossom as a family. 
    These wonderful thoughts made him feel warm and tingly inside. Suddenly, 
    without warning, Tony was yanked from his daydream. He let out a long sigh,
    realizing that that would be the courier with the divorce papers.</p>

          </p>   My name is Katherine Coloma. I am currently attending at City College of New York and majoring in Studio Art. I will soon be graduating on May 2014.  I am working as a optometric technician at Malik Eye Care.  I was born in Ecuador and came to the United States by the age of 11. Some of my mayor interests are photography and traveling.
